            <p class="hiddenmsg">Well done.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">That suited monster likely won't not find us here. Time will tell though.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">You might not realize it, but you have been caught in the middle of a chase. It's after me. I found out too much.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">Ever since you became aware of my existence it's had it's sights on you as well. It'll use any means necessary to get to me.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">It's grasp on this reality is immense, and it can sense you and your thoughs. Even reading this silently is extremely risky for you.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">However, given your dedication to dig deeper, I felt obliged to let you know roughly what's going on. And yes, this does have something to do with my Half-Life series.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">It was through the game I came in contact with it. It was up to something. Something huge. But seemingly also something very sensitive.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">It doesn't want to continue it's plan as long as I'm aware of it's existence. I WOULD like to let you know more, but that would make you just as much of a target as me.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">I'm not gonna let anyone else suffer through the same things it has and continues to put me through.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">I'm afraid you can't get rid of it. Neither can I. Not yet.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">When I figure something out, when I find a countermeasure I WILL be in touch, trust me.</p>
            <p class="hiddenmsg">Be patient until then. DON'T lose your guard. DON'T trust your eyes. But most importantly make sure it never finds out what you learned today.</p>
